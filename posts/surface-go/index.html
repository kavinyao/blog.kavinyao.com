      Why I Ditched Surface Go 5 Hours After Purchase
     </h1>
     <p>
      I cannot deny how much video I stream on a daily basis. In fact, my monthly data usage has been consistently exceeding the 1TB limit. And salute to Google for inventing Chromecast so I can watch many videos in the living room on my cozy sofa. While the majority of the videos I watch can be casted, there are still plenty of websites that offer video content don&rsquo;t support Chromecast. Luckily, if you use Chrome you can cast any tab to your TV. I&rsquo;m not sure how it works but it works darn good. The only limit is that you can only cast a tab from desktop (e.g. Windows or Mac).
     </p>
     <p>
      Since my PC is not on the same floor as living room, every time I need to cast a tab to watch it on TV I have to run down stairs or use some remote desktop software (that works 90% of the time) to start the cast. This doesn&rsquo;t sound like a big deal but it&rsquo;s getting increasingly annoying over the time. As a result, having some device that can cast a tab right in the living room seems the logical step to follow.
     </p>
     <p>
      As you can tell I don&rsquo;t need anything remotely powerful. iPad was the first consideration but since the iOS chrome app doesn&rsquo;t have the cast tab functionality I had to skip it. A cheap 2-in-1 Windows laptop seems perfect for this task. TheWireCutter recommended Asus but it&rsquo;s out of stock on Amazon. After some more research Surface Go came into eyes. Watched several popular reviews on Youtube and everybody recommended it. Read Amazon reviews, same story. Okay, I was pretty sold. Anyway MS tablet in theory should have better quality and integration than 3rd party one. I wanted it so badly that I rushed to the nearest BestBuy to get one.
     </p>
     <p>
      Problem solved? Not quite.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Hardware
     </h2>
     <p>
      The build quality is actually really good and exceeded my expectations. Microsoft has been doing a great job designing the Surface family and I can understand the success behind it.
     </p>
     <p>
      The speakers are the best part of this device. It&rsquo;s powerful and simply better than the mono channel speaker on iPad 6th gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The hinge is also great. I missed it after switching to iPad and it frustrates me that I had to buy another accessory to make my iPad stand.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Impression on Windows 10
     </h2>
     <p>
      I use Windows 10 on my gaming PC. I like it and don&rsquo;t understand the hate many people have. Isn&rsquo;t it impressive that Win10 is versatile enough to run on a tablet with a similar form factor to iPad with reasonable battery life (although real life usage would reveal it&rsquo;s much worse than an iPad)?
     </p>
     <p>
      The beginning was a little bit awkward as Surface Go doesn&rsquo;t power on, even after charging. I had to resort to hard reset (power + volume up at the same time).
     </p>
     <p>
      The tablet experience feels like a good idea but flawed execution. For example, the Cortana guided initial setup is great for less tech savvy users, which are the majority of Windows&rsquo;s user base. However the experience is not as smooth as it should be. And bugs like Cortana asks to &ldquo;enter your WiFi password&rdquo; for 10+ times make it even worse. One would also expect Win10 would run in tablet mode by default since I wasn&rsquo;t using the keyboard cover. But no, you have to enable the tablet mode manually.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chrome, probably like the most apps made for desktop, is not optimized for tablet mode. The UI controls are small and hard to tap on (I didn&rsquo;t find a setting to make them bigger); the virtual keyboard doesn&rsquo;t pop up automatically when I need to type username or password. Edge has better integration (e.g. virtual keyboard pops up when I need to type). It&rsquo;s also said to be better for battery life.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before we continue, I want to make it clear that I had very realistic expectations. The tablet doesn&rsquo;t need to run PUBG at 60fps. It doesn&rsquo;t need to run Photoshop and Word at the same time. It doesn&rsquo;t need to handle 5 chrome tabs. It just needs to play a single video stream at 1080P. Period. But the constant micro lags and infrequent sluggishness really irritated me as a user. Everything works but the experience is not enjoyable. Maybe I have been indulged by Apple hardware too much. And switching to iPad after this is such a wonderful experience.
     </p>
     <h2>
      The S Mode
     </h2>
     <p>
      I can understand the rationale behind the S mode. MS wants to make something similar to iOS, a more closed ecosystem where MS can exert tighter control. And arguably it&rsquo;s also better for the average user as it&rsquo;s less likely to get viruses. I was actually going to experience S mode and see how good it works and then decide whether to turn it off. But hey, it&rsquo;s hard to experience it when there&rsquo;s no official app for Youtube or Twitch in the app store. Twitch does have one but you need to opt out S mode first in order to use it. And it&rsquo;s just a wrapper of the website and has terrible integration with Windows. For example, in full screen mode some UI elements just don&rsquo;t disappear. Twitch full screen works as expected in Edge but there&rsquo;s other problem (will discuss later). Youtube on Edge also sucks. Live stream just stops after 4-5 minutes. It was literally unusable. As a result of all these I had to opt out of S mode.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Chromecast
     </h2>
     <p>
      This is my main use case. In all honesty it worked mostly fine. Although it takes quite some time (30s+) before the cast control appears but once the cast starts there&rsquo;s no lag or stuttering. Another nitpick is that you cannot turn off display and let cast run in the background. As a result, I had to keep Surface Go connected to power so its battery doesn&rsquo;t run out.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Conclusion
     </h2>
     <p>
      Since my primary use case is to watch live streams, not having a way to watch streams without lagging or stuttering is a real deal breaker for me. And considering the overall suboptimal experience (remember I already set my expectations pretty low), I decided to return it and switch to an iPad.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before the return I did full factory reset to wipe out my personal data. It&rsquo;s a nice feature and kudos to MS for a feature respecting user&rsquo;s privacy. It was slow though. It took 2 hours(?) to wipe everything off the 128GB SSD.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the return Surface Go refused to power on again. The BestBuy employee seemed surprised. I showed him the reset trick and he said &ldquo;I kinda understand why you want to return the device.&rdquo; I guess maybe it&rsquo;s not a widespread issue. But even if that&rsquo;s the case, it shows a quality control problem.
