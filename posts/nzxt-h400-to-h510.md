title: Transition from NZXT H400 to H510
date: 2020-09-08

I've been using NZXT H400 for over 2 years. It's a very good looking and well-built case despite the price tag. Initially I transferred my then ITX build into it and needless to say lots of space was wasted. When I [switched from Intel to AMD](/posts/goodbye-intel-hello-amd), I took the opportunity and upgraded to an mATX system — the largest form factor H400 supports. mATX is so much better compared to ITX for those who don't need extreme compactness. With the positive experience with mATX I totally see myself getting an ATX build eventually, given that a compact mid-tower case is not much bigger than H400 (in fact H510 is only 12% larger than H400 in terms of volume).

Recently I need to swap out the PSU from my H400 build which presented a perfect opportunity to upgrade the case. To summarize, the reasons I move away from H400 include:

- It only supports mATX motherboards, which are rarely made these days for some reason so the choices are limited and price tags tend to be higher than they should be.
- The tempered glass side panel is mounted with 4 thumb screws and it's not fun to unscrew 4 of them every time you need to take the panel off.
- The PSU bracket does make PSU installation easier but the mechanism is not as reliable. For my case one of the thumb screw got stuck and I had to forcibly pull it out.
- The cable bar is too obtrusive and sometimes gets in the way.

Honestly none of these are deal-breakers but over the time working with this case becomes more and more frustrated. However I'm not throwing it away but instead plan to reuse it for a home server build later.

The reasons I chose H510:

- I still like NZXT's minimalistic and understated aesthetics.
- It supports ATX motherboards.
- The glass side panel installation is screwless — well almost, there's 1 thumb screw in the back to further secure it.
- The cable bar is less obtrusive.
- It's compact and only slightly larger than H400 so I can still keep it on my desk.
- It has a USB 3.1 Gen2-compatible USB-C connector.
- It's cheap. The non-i version only costs $70.

Basically all my problems with H400 are fixed in H510.

There's one thing I don't like H500: thermals and noise. Since I literally transplanted my mATX build from H400 to H510, the only variable is the case. And the fans are running noticeably louder and CPU temp is also higher at idle or load. This is not a surprise though since [plenty of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HK5Aulw7YI) [reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ixFt7h8fak) have pointed out this problem. [Some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApdliGCqtZg) even suggested not using any front in-take fans as they don't help with reducing CPU temp at load. I found this claim to be true but having front in-take fans will help CPU idle temp, which I consider a win. I'll use it for a few more days and decide if the noise is tolerable.
